### Recommendations:
- Summer and Fall were high activity seasons in Asheville, so it could be worth expanding the amount of listings offered during those seasons.

- Neighborhood 28806 had the most listings (807) and the lowest average listing price ($146.46).  It also had the most total reviews (88,316), in addition to the highest average number of reviews a month (2.12).  That being said, neighborhood 28806 shows high potential to be a good market for Airbnb listings.
    - The type of listings with the highest availability in this neighborhood was entire homes/apartments (706 listings).  Entire home/apartment listings also experienced the most activity, generating 78,490 reviews.  Entire home/apartment listings could be a good focus for neighborhood 28806.

- The most expensive neighborhood was 28704, with an average listing price of $203.29.  With 191 listings, this neighborhood ranked third-lowest in listing availability.  It also ranked third-lowest in terms of activity, generating 14,428 reviews.  Due to the pricier nature of the listings in this neighborhood and that it ranked third-lowest in terms of availability and activity, I wouldn’t necessarily consider expanding in this neighborhood.

- The most common listing type was for an entire home/apartment (2,571 listings).  Entire home/apartment listings also had the most activity, generating 287,038 reviews.  With that, offering listings for an entire home/apartment seems to be a good market to focus on.

- The least common listing types were for hotel rooms (12 listings) and shared rooms (8 listings).  Hotel rooms seem to be the least popular, as they experienced the least amount of activity (304 reviews).  As a result, listings for hotel rooms do not seem to offer high potential for success in Asheville.
